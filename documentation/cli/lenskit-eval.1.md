lenskit-eval
============

Name
----

**lenskit eval** - run an offline evaluation of recommender behavior and
performance.

Synopsis
--------

**lenskit** [GLOBAL OPTIONS] **eval** [OPTIONS] [*TARGET*...]

Description
-----------

The `eval` command runs a LensKit evaluation script to measure the
behavior and performance (such as recommendation or prediction accuracy)
of one or more recommender algorithms.

Evaluation scripts are written in Groovy, using an embedded
domain-specific language for describing LensKit evaluations. This is
documented more in the LensKit manual; there is a link in See Also.

The **lenskit eval** subcommand serves the same purpose as the
now-deprecated **lenskit-eval** command, with slightly different
invocation syntax. Use **lenskit eval** in new scripts and experiments.

Options
-------

*TARGET*
:   Run the target *TARGET* in the evaluation script. If no targets are
    specified on the command line, the script is run (which is
    sufficient for scripts that do not use targets), or the default
    target specified by the script is run.

--help
:   Show usage help.

-f *SCRIPT*, --file *SCRIPT*
:   Load evaluation script *SCRIPT*. The default is `eval.groovy`.

-j *N*, --thread-count *N*
:   Use up to *N* threads for parallelizable portions of the evaluation.

-F, --force
:   Force eval tasks to re-run, even if they detect that their outputs
    are up-to-date. Not all tasks do up-to-date checking.

This command also takes the standard [script environment
options](lenskit-script-environment.7.html).

Name

*lenskit* - a command-line tool for LensKit

Synopsis
--------

**lenskit** [OPTIONS] *subcommand* [arguments]

Description
-----------

The LensKit command line tool provides several capabilities for
examining, evaluating, and using LensKit recommender algorithms. It
primarily operates on LensKit algorithm configurations and eval scripts
written in the corresponding Groovy DSLs.

The various specific tools are exposed via subcommands, much like
**git**(1) and similar tools. The subcommands are listed below (see
[Subcommands](#Subcommands)), and each is described in more detail in
its own manual page.

Options
-------

--help
:   Print usage instructions.

--log-file *FILE*
:   Write logging output to *FILE*.

-d, --debug
:   Increase verbosity, printing debug messages to the console. By
    default, only messages at INFO and higher levels are logged. The log
    file, if specified, always receives debug-level output.

--debug-grapht
:   Output INFO (or DEBUG, if **--debug** is also used) logging messages
    from Grapht. Grapht is pretty noisy, so by default its output is
    filtered to warnigns and errors. If you need to debug a problem that
    is occurring in Grapht, use this option.

Subcommands
-----------

Each command is documented in its own man page, *lenskit-command*(1).

[version](lenskit-version.1.html)
:   Print the LensKit version.

[train-model](lenskit-train-model.1.html)
:   Train a recommender model and save it to disk.

[predict](lenskit-predict.1.html)
:   Predict user ratings for items, using a configuration or a trained
    model.

[recommend](lenskit-recommend.1.html)
:   Recommend items for users, using a configuration or a trained model.

[global-recommend](lenskit-global-recommend.1.html)
:   Recommend items with respect to a set of reference items.

[graph](lenskit-graph.1.html)
:   Output a GraphViz diagram of a recommender configuration (either
    from configuration files or a trained model).

[eval](lenskit-eval.1.html)
:   Run a LensKit evaluation script.

[pack-ratings](lenskit-pack-ratings.1.html)
:   Pack rating data into a binary file for more efficient access.

Environment and System Properties
---------------------------------

The LensKit CLI (or its launcher script) recognize the following
environment variables:

JAVA\_OPTS
:   Additional flags to pass to the JVM (such as `-Xmx4g` to set the
    memory limit).

JAVA\_HOME
:   Where to find the Java Runtime Environment.

Also, the following Java system properties can be set for useful
effects:

logback.configurationFile
:   The location of a Logback configuration file. This overrides all
    built-in or command line logging configuration.
